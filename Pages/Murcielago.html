            <h1>Model biography</h1>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Lamborghini created the Aventador SVJ to embrace challenges head-on, combining
                cutting-edge technology with extraordinary design, while always refusing to compromise. In a future
                driven by technology, it‚Äôs easy to lose the genuine thrill of driving. But in the future shaped by
                Lamborghini, this won‚Äôt be left behind, because there will always be a driver behind the wheel.First
                presented to the world in 2002, the Murci√©lago represented the most technically advanced Lamborghinis
                ever produced.</p>

            <h1>INTERIOR</h1>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Using Computer Aided Design, parts were created accurately and repeatably,
                while designers could push the limits further than ever before with confidence. Furthermore, the
                Murci√©lago was the first Lamborghini to be conceived and entirely designed by the in-house Centro Stile
                team, led by Luc Donckerwolke. It was also the first Lamborghini to be planned from the start as both a
                closed and open version. With the Murci√©lago, production sales numbers grew and, up until 2010 when it
                was removed from sale, 4,099 cars had been produced, divided into numerous series, including the R-GT
                and R-SV racing versions.

            <h1>LIFESTYLE</h1>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The 2008 film "The Dark Knight", part of the Batman series, featured a
                Murci√©lago LP 640 as the personal car of the main character, played by actor Christian Bale. Many have
                questioned since whether or not the batman could ever drive any other car. In fact, the word Murci√©lago,
                in Spanish, in addition to identifying a breed of fighting bulls, means bat. Production numbers grew
                with Murci√©lago, and until 2010, when its production stopped, 4099 cars were produced divided into
                numerous series, including the R-GT and R-SV racing versions.

            <h1>Technical Features</h1>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The Murci√©lago debuted with the 6.2-liter engine, which had a maximum power
                output of 580 CV. The established V12 engine with double overhead camshaft and four valves per cylinder,
                was mounted longitudinally at the rear. The car was characterized by having the gearbox mounted ahead of
                it, practically inside the passenger compartment, to allow for a shorter wheelbase and better weight
                balance. The first series of Murci√©lago still had the option of the manual six-speed gearbox.
