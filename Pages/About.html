            <b>Lamborghini is a luxury sports car manufacturer based in Italy, known for its
                high-performance, stylish,
                and exotic vehicles. It was founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini with the aim of competing with
                established brands like Ferrari. The company is famous for producing iconic models like the
                Aventador,
                Hurac√°n, and Urus. Lamborghini cars are characterized by their powerful engines, sharp designs, and
                advanced technology. Today, Lamborghini is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its Audi division
                and
                continues to be a symbol of speed and prestige.
                The brand uses the raging bull as its logo, symbolizing strength, power, and the founder‚Äôs zodiac
                sign,
                Taurus. Over the years, Lamborghini has also entered the world of racing and hybrid technology. Its
                cars
                are often featured in movies, video games, and luxury collections worldwide. Despite being a niche
                manufacturer, Lamborghini has a massive global fan base and continues to set benchmarks in the
                supercar
                industry.</b>

            The event hosted 500 guests and featured interactive installations, an ad-hoc DJ set, visual arts, and
            experiences that left a lasting impression. Guests transitioned from the custom-built pavilion to the
            exhibition area, where several Lamborghini models, dressed in the colors of the Italian flag, welcomed them
            and set the tone for the evening ‚Äî all in pure Italian style. The key highlight of the event was the debut

            true ‚ÄúFuoriclasse,‚Äù standing in a league of its own. Its 920 CV twin-turbo V8 hybrid powertrain offers
            exceptional performance and comfort for an unmatched driving experience. Developed from scratch in
            Sant‚ÄôAgata Bolognese, the twin-turbo V8 is the first and only engine in a production super sports car
            capable of reaching 10,000 rpm. Temerario is not only a benchmark in terms of performance, but also in
